## Using the Pomodoro Technique for Effective Studying

![](https://imgs.search.brave.com/_eNea96mTiBW18TIXpaKI08GnKXM2GfdkHmmlEddbiQ/rs:fit:940:788:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcm9k/dWN0aXZlY2x1Yi5j/b20vd3AtY29udGVu/dC91cGxvYWRzLzIw/MjAvMDgvVGhlLVBv/bW9kb3JvLVRlY2hu/aXF1ZS1FeHBsYWlu/ZWQuanBlZw)

The renowned 'tomato' (*pomodoro* in italian) technique has several possible variations, but its name is associated with the following setup with the intent of maximizing focus and efficiency:
- 3 x (25 minutes of studying : 5 minutes of break)
- 1 x (25 minutes of studying : 30 minutes of break)
- *Repeat*

The simple notion, bolstered by research, is the implementation of a break that juxtaposes the sedentary lifestyle of studying. By taking a break from studying, we are able to recharge our ability to focus for another 25 minutes, especially in our use of social media that has attuned us to short bursts of stimulation.

My recommended way to implement this cyclical bout of 25 minutes of studying to a 5-minute break is to use the [Forest app](https://www.forestapp.cc/). It serves as an effective timer and includes the motivation of completing each time block through growing a tree and rewards.

### How do I use my break?
The 5 minutes are short but can be surprisingly effective to prepare you for another 25 minutes of studying. The point is to get up from your seat and at least move around somewhat. In my opinion, the best option is to do a mini workout to get your blood flowing and keep your mind from falling asleep. There are various other options like taking a nap (notably during the 30 minutes), getting snacks/water, meditate, listen to music, chat with someone, etc, but I prefer and notice physical activity is the most effective for me.
