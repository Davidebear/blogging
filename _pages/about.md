Ciao! My name is David Bearden. Presently, I am an undergraduate student passionately studying **biomedical engineering** and **computer science** on the premed track. I have various penchants (notable ones listed on home page) and admire unwonted concepts and perspectives.

This website was originally designed for myself and to apply the *Feynman Technique*, but if you stop by, I hope you learn something and always appreciate feedback, especially a different viewpoint!

~ Stay curious.
