Ciao! My name is **David Bearden**.  

I am an undergraduate student passionately studying biomedical engineering and computer science while fulfilling the premed requirements to attend medical school. I have several penchants which pivot on both an admiration for unwonted concepts and perspectives and a burning desire to help others and shoulder their burdens. 

~ Stay curious.
