Ciao! My name is **David Bearden**.  

Presently, I am an undergraduate student passionately studying biomedical engineering and computer science on the premed track. I have various penchants (some listed on home page) and admire *unwonted concepts and perspectives*.

This website was designed with the intent of applying the *Feynman Technique* to my listed interests, but if you stop by, I hope you learn something and always appreciate some feedback, especially a different viewpoint!

~ Stay curious.
