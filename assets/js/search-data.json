            "content": "Using the Pomodoro Technique for Effective Studying . . The renowned ‘tomato’ (pomodoro in italian) technique has several possible variations, but its name is associated with the following setup with the intent of maximizing focus and efficiency: . 3 x (25 minutes of studying : 5 minutes of break) | 1 x (25 minutes of studying : 30 minutes of break) | Repeat | . The simple notion, bolstered by research, is the implementation of a break that juxtaposes the sedentary lifestyle of studying. By taking a break from studying, we are able to recharge our ability to focus for another 25 minutes, especially in our use of social media that has attuned us to short bursts of stimulation. . My recommended way to implement this cyclical bout of 25 minutes of studying to a 5-minute break is to use the Forest app. It serves as an effective timer and includes the motivation of completing each time block through growing a tree and rewards. . How do I use my break? . The 5 minutes are short but can be surprisingly effective to prepare you for another 25 minutes of studying. The point is to get up from your seat and at least move around somewhat. In my opinion, the best option is to do a mini workout to get your blood flowing and keep your mind from falling asleep. There are various other options like taking a nap (notably during the 30 minutes), getting snacks/water, meditate, listen to music, chat with someone, etc, but I prefer and notice physical activity is the most effective for me. . 5 min Home Workouts **ABS** 30 flutter kicks 30 penguins 30 russian twists 15 leg raises 15 knee crunches **Full** 30 Push ups 12 Pull ups 20 Candle Leg Raises 30 Squats Up down swings .

            "content": "Entering the World of Machine Learning: Index 0 . What is machine learning? That was the question I faced several weeks ago. . My first introduction was at an event I attended on a whim because a doctor (MD) would be attending as a speaker. The talk revealed general adversarial networks (GANs) and their mind-boggling power and varieties, as well as, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that could perform at the same discerning level as the average radiologist. It was incredible to think that with the laptop in my backpack I could design a neural network capable of discerning images at approximately the same level as a human who spent years honing their craft. . I took a 15 hour crash course I found on YouTube and learned all the fundamentals of how a neural network was built (its architecture) and how it “learned.” It was honestly quite a spectacle and rigorous. For anyone who wishes to enter the field, it is definitely necessary to at least have a foundational understanding of matrix algebra. Though understanding matrices and their operations are not necessary to create a model, it does facilitate the assimilation of new concepts and makes the whole idea of machine learning seem less whimsical and more mathematical. . In the end, the course only taught me the theory. It explained the power of CNNs and the mathematical operation called a “convolution” that they utilized. Though the course was definitely informative, it made me realize that the best way to learn is by “getting your hands dirty.” Working on a project forces you to actually understand the concepts and motivates you to learn. The field of machine learning is extremely vast. After getting the basics down of what constitutes a neural network, which only takes a few hours. Build. Experiment. Learn. . One of my favorite courses that adheres to this concept is FastAI which is a high-level package that is used to bolster the effectiveness and usage of the PyTorch library. It is too early to say anything, as I have only completed the first two chapters of the book and first three lessons of several. Nonetheless, it is an impactful, comprehensive course that truly motivates you with constant examples of application through Jupiter notebooks. . Time and deliberation will eventually make me capable of harnessing the utility of machine learning toward several projects in my undergraduate and future career. .",
